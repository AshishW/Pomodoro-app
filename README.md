## About the Project

This Pomodoro Timer is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app helps users manage their time effectively by breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

### Features

- **Timer Functionality**: The timer counts down from 25 minutes and alerts the user when the session is over.
- **Mood Sounds**: Users can choose from different ambient sounds (light rain, campfire, sea waves) to play in the background while working.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: The background changes dynamically based on the selected mood sound.

### How to Use

1. **Start the Timer**: Press the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
2. **Select Mood Sound**: Click on one of the mood buttons to play a background sound and change the background gradient.
3. **Work and Relax**: Focus on your task until the timer rings, then take a short break before starting the next session.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For the timer functionality and interactive features.
